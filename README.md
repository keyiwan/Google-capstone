# Google-capstone
This is a capstone challenge for analysis on rental bike data.

As the last part of my [Google Data Analytics Certificate](https://coursera.org/share/9818f287924f4512ec3145d8afb6b99b), I conducted a data analysis on sharing bike data and share visualisations on some important findings.

Tool for data cleaning and visualisation: RStudio - R language.

This work is divided into two parts. Part 1 is for **Process**, codes from [bike-sharing01.Rmd](https://github.com/keyiwan/Google-capstone/blob/main/bike-sharing01.Rmd) and final presentation from [bike-sharing01.md](https://github.com/keyiwan/Google-capstone/blob/main/bike-sharing01.md).  
Part 2 is for **Analysis** and **Share**, codes - [bike-sharing02.Rmd](https://github.com/keyiwan/Google-capstone/blob/main/bike-sharing02.Rmd) , ouput - [bike-sharing02.md](https://github.com/keyiwan/Google-capstone/blob/main/bike-sharing02.md).
